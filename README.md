# Version Control & Collaboration for Webflow: Stay in Sync and Build Together


Version Control & Collaboration for Webflow: Stay in Sync and Build Together
Maintaining order and working together seamlessly on Webflow projects requires effective version control and collaboration tools. Here's a quick guide with some clean code examples:

**Version Control:**

  - **Git Integration:** Connect your Webflow project to a Git repository like GitHub or GitLab. This allows you to:
    - **Track changes:** See a history of revisions and revert to previous versions if needed.
    - **Branching & merging:** Collaborate on parallel features or bug fixes without affecting the main project.
    - **Code export/import:** Share and integrate custom code snippets between team members.

    
**Example:**

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Added new features and bug fixes"
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/your-webflow-project.git
git push origin main
```

**Collaboration:**

  - **Webflow Editor:** Share your project with team members for real-time editing and collaboration within the Webflow interface.
  - **Design Handoff:** Use tools like Zeplin or Avocode to export design assets and code snippets for developers.
  - **Project Cloning:** Easily clone your project for individual development and testing before merging back to the main codebase.

**Example:**
```
1. Grant editor access to team members in Webflow's Sharing settings.
2. Export design assets and code from Webflow to Zeplin or Avocode.
3. Clone the project from Webflow for individual development.
4. Push your changes to the relevant branch in your Git repository.
5. Use merge requests to propose changes and collaborate on the main project.
```
**Remember:**

  - Choose a version control and collaboration workflow that suits your team size and project complexity.
  - Communicate effectively and document changes within your codebase for seamless collaboration.
  - Leverage Webflow's built-in features and external tools to streamline your workflow.
